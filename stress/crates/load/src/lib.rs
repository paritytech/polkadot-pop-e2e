//! The runner every scenario shares: baseline, load until the chain fails (or the plan ends),
//! recovery, loss check. A scenario brings lanes of txs and a plan; everything else is here.
//!
//! The tracker ([`tracker`]) owns every tx and is plain code: it is fed by the send tick, the
//! submit replies ([`sender`]) and the block follower ([`follower`]), so it has no lock and is
//! tested without a network.
