//! Every metric a run reads or writes, with its type, unit and labels.
//!
//! Node metrics are read from `/metrics`; the preflight checks each `# TYPE` against this list,
//! because names don't tell the type (`substrate_sub_txpool_validations_scheduled` is a counter
//! without `_total`). Our own metrics start with `stress_`; each is a typed handle, so a gauge
//! can't be written as a counter and a label can't be missing (the label count is in the type).
