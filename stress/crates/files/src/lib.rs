//! The on-disk contract of a stress run. Every part of a run (load tool, chain recorder,
//! scraper) writes its own raw file in `results/<run id>/`; the build step merges them into
//! `run.om`, and the evaluator reads only that. This crate is the one place that knows the
//! formats, so each part can be its own process.
